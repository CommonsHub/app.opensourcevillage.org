# About

Open Source Village is a project to power community gatherings with decentralized technology.

## Mission

Create tools that help communities organize, connect, and collaborate—without relying on centralized platforms.

## The Project

Open Source Village started as a way to coordinate activities at open source events. Participants receive NFC badges that link to their NOSTR identities, allowing them to:

- **Create offers**: Share workshops, talks, and 1:1 sessions
- **RSVP to events**: Reserve spots and plan schedules
- **Exchange tokens**: Participate in a lightweight token economy
- **Connect with others**: Find people with shared interests

## Technology Choices

### NOSTR Protocol

We use NOSTR for identity and messaging because:

- **Self-sovereign identity**: Users own their keys
- **Censorship resistant**: No single point of control
- **Interoperable**: Works with existing NOSTR clients
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and implement

### Token Economy

A lightweight token system encourages participation:

- Creates accountability (posting has a cost)
- Reduces spam
- Gamifies engagement
- Optional blockchain backing for transparency

### File-based Storage

For simplicity and portability:

- No database required
- Easy backup and migration
- Human-readable data
- Works offline

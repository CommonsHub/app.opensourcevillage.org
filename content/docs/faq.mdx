# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Open Source Village.

## General

### What is Open Source Village?

Open Source Village is an application for community gatherings where participants can create offers (workshops, talks, 1:1s), RSVP to events, and exchange tokens. It uses NFC badges for identity and NOSTR for decentralized messaging.

### What is NOSTR?

NOSTR (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a simple, open protocol for decentralized social networking. It uses cryptographic keys for identity and relays for message distribution.

### Do I need cryptocurrency to use this?

No. The tokens are managed server-side and don't require any crypto wallets or transactions from users. The blockchain integration is optional and primarily for token accounting.

## Badges

### How do I get a badge?

Badges are distributed at the event. Each badge has a unique NFC chip with a serial number that links to your account.

### What if my badge doesn't work?

1. Make sure NFC is enabled on your phone
2. Hold the phone directly against the badge
3. Try different positions (NFC antenna location varies)
4. Contact an organizer if issues persist

### Can I transfer my badge to someone else?

No. Once a badge is claimed, it's permanently linked to your NOSTR identity.

## Tokens

### How do tokens work?

- You receive 50 tokens when claiming your badge
- Creating an offer costs 1 token
- RSVPing to an offer costs 1 token
- Tokens are used to prevent spam and encourage participation

### What happens if I run out of tokens?

You won't be able to create new offers or RSVP to events. Participate in the community to earn more tokens (coming soon).

### Are tokens real cryptocurrency?

The tokens can be backed by real ERC20 tokens on a blockchain, but users don't need wallets or gas fees. The server handles all blockchain interactions.

## Profile

### How do I update my profile?

1. Go to `/profile/edit`
2. Update your name, bio, and avatar
3. Sign the update with your NOSTR key
4. Changes are saved and published to NOSTR

### Can I change my username?

Currently, usernames cannot be changed after claiming. Choose wisely!

### How do I add an avatar?

1. Go to profile edit page
2. Click on the avatar placeholder
3. Upload an image (max 1MB)
4. Save your profile

## Offers & RSVPs

### What types of offers can I create?

- Workshops (hands-on learning sessions)
- Talks (presentations)
- 1:1 sessions (mentoring, pairing)
- Services (anything you can offer)

### How do I cancel an RSVP?

1. Go to the offer page
2. Click "Cancel RSVP"
3. Confirm the cancellation
4. Your token is refunded

### Why can't I RSVP to an offer?

Common reasons:
- The offer is at capacity
- You've already RSVPed
- You don't have enough tokens
- The offer has ended

## Technical

### Where is my data stored?

Profile and activity data is stored on the server in `data/npubs/:npub/`. Events are also published to configured NOSTR relays.

### Is my data private?

- Profile data is public (published to NOSTR)
- Tokens and balances are stored server-side
- Group messages are only visible to group members (NIP-29)

### Can I self-host this?

Yes! The app is open source. See the [Installation guide](/docs/installation) for setup instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### The app is slow

- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear browser cache

### Events aren't showing up

- Verify relay connections in settings
- Check browser console for errors
- Events may take a few seconds to propagate

### Login/signature issues

- Make sure you're using a compatible NOSTR extension
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that your nsec is correct
